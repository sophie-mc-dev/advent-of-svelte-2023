A Svelte challenge for each day until Christmas Eve of 2023!

# The challenges
Every year, Santa and his elves work around the clock to prepare for Christmas. This year, however, he faces an unprecedented challenge. The Magical Christmas Code, which powers Santa's Sleigh and ensures the smooth delivery of presents, was shattered into 24 fragments.

Santa immediately called upon his sentient robot assistant Svelte Bot to get the sleigh operational, but they can't do it alone. Each day, a new challenge awaits - a unique puzzle that, when solved, will unlock a fragment of the Magical Christmas Code . Will you help Santa and Svelte Bot fix the Sleigh and save Christmas?!
